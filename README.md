Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

Procedure:
Introduction to Prompt Patterns: Begin by understanding the following prompt patterns: ‚óã Query Decomposition: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts. ‚óã Decision Making: Asking the model to choose between options or directions. ‚óã Answer Engineering: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the answer. ‚óã Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies. ‚óã Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis. ‚óã Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one. ‚óã Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.
Choosing the Content Type: Decide on the type of content you want to create. This could be: ‚óã Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports, etc.) ‚óã Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations) ‚óã Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles) ‚óã Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)
For example, you could choose a business report on market trends, a case study on a successful startup, or even a story-based prompt like creating a fictional world for a comic.
Creating the Prompts: ‚óã Start with simple prompts to generate initial content. ‚óã Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making (asking the model to pick one of several options), tail generation (extending the narrative), and semantic filtering (adjusting style or tone).
Generating and Refining Outputs: Use the model to generate initial drafts, and then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments: ‚óã For a report, prompt the model with basic data, then ask for a deeper analysis and insights. ‚óã For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, or actions.
Review and Evaluation: After generating content, evaluate the outputs for: ‚óã Coherence: Is the generated content logical and structured? ‚óã Creativity/Originality: Is the content engaging and fresh? ‚óã Accuracy: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)? ‚óã Tone and Style: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?
Test Case Scenarios for Content Generation: (USE ANY 2) content generation scenarios:

Instructions:
Select a Topic: Choose a topic (e.g., market trends, climate change, sci-fi story) that interests you.
Use Basic Prompts: Start by crafting simple, general prompts to generate initial content.
Refine Your Prompts: Gradually introduce more complexity by adding details, refining the structure, and using different prompt techniques like decision making or semantic filtering.
Evaluate the Output: Review the generated content for clarity, creativity, and accuracy.
Iterate for Improvement: Based on the feedback, refine the prompts and regenerate the content as needed.
Deliverables:
First Draft: A basic draft of the report, case study, article, or story generated using simple prompts.
Refined Content: A more detailed and structured output, achieved by applying more advanced prompt techniques.
Multiple Versions: Different versions of the content, showing the effect of prompt changes on the output.
Final Version: The polished version of the content after incorporating feedback and refining the prompts.
OUTPUT
üìå Demonstration of Prompting Techniques in Content Creation
1. Query Decomposition
Break a complex query into smaller sub-queries.

Prompt Example:

Instead of: ‚ÄúWrite a case study on renewable energy adoption in India.‚Äù

Use:

‚ÄúList major renewable energy sources in India.‚Äù
‚ÄúSummarize government policies supporting them.‚Äù
‚ÄúProvide 2 case studies of successful projects.‚Äù
‚ÄúCombine into a coherent case study.‚Äù
Effect: Produces structured, detailed, and fact-rich content rather than a surface-level overview.

2. Decision-Making Prompts
Guide the model to choose among options or frameworks.

Prompt Example (Report):

‚ÄúUse SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) to evaluate electric vehicles in India.‚Äù
Prompt Example (Creative Writing):

‚ÄúChoose one of these genres‚Äîsci-fi, comedy, or fantasy‚Äîand write a one-page comic book script about AI in education.‚Äù
Effect: Adds direction and focus, prevents generic responses.

3. Semantic Filtering
Control style, tone, or relevance using constraints.

Prompt Example (Article):

‚ÄúWrite a 500-word article on AI in healthcare, suitable for a newspaper audience, avoiding technical jargon.‚Äù
Prompt Example (Case Study):

‚ÄúProvide a case study on Tesla‚Äôs marketing, but exclude financial data and focus only on customer engagement strategies.‚Äù
Effect: Ensures audience-fit and relevance.

4. Role-based Prompting
Ask the model to adopt a perspective or role.

Prompt Example (Report):

‚ÄúYou are a policy advisor writing a government report on cybersecurity threats.‚Äù
Prompt Example (Comic Book):

‚ÄúYou are a comic scriptwriter. Write a 6-panel dialogue where a robot explains climate change to a child.‚Äù
Effect: Shapes voice, structure, and depth according to the role.

5. Chain-of-Thought / Stepwise Guidance
Encourage structured reasoning before the final output.

Prompt Example (Article):

‚ÄúBefore writing the final article, first outline the key sections on AI in education, then expand each into full paragraphs.‚Äù
Prompt Example (Case Study):

‚ÄúStep 1: Identify the problem. Step 2: Provide background. Step 3: Discuss solutions. Step 4: Conclude with lessons learned.‚Äù
Effect: Improves logical flow and coherence.

üìä Comparing Across Formats
Technique	Report (Analytical)	Article (General)	Case Study (Practical)	Comic (Creative)
Query Decomposition	Clear structure	Depth in details	Step-by-step evidence	Episodic story
Decision-Making	Framework-based	Focused lens	Comparative insights	Genre control
Semantic Filtering	Policy-focused	Audience-fit	Scope-limited	Age-appropriate
Role-based Prompting	Formal, expert tone	Journalist voice	Consultant voice	Character-driven
Stepwise Guidance	Coherent sections	Smooth flow	Problem-solution style	Story arc logic
‚úÖ Takeaway: By altering the prompting structure, we can significantly shift the quality, tone, coherence, and usefulness of AI-generated outputs across domains‚Äîfrom formal reports to playful comics.

Conclusion:
By applying various prompting techniques, you can generate high-quality content for a wide range of use cases, from business reports and case studies to creative works like short stories and articles. This experiment demonstrates how structured prompting can guide AI models like ChatGPT to create coherent, accurate, and engaging outputs tailored to specific needs.
